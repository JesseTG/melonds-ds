        please [report it or comment on an existing report](https://github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS/issues)
        in its issue tracker.**
        You may continue to submit this bug report,
        and it will be considered resolved when a fix upstream is integrated.

        - Yes, in the latest commit on master.
