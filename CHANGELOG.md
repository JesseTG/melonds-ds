All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0),
and this project roughly adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2024-02-13

### Added

- Added a subsystem for loading a GBA ROM without save data.
- Added options to configure the emulated console's starting time.
  The starting time can be the local time (possibly with an offset) or an absolute time.
- Added the ability to synchronize the emulated console's time with the host system's time.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where some homebrew would be incorrectly detected as DSiWare,
  resulting in a crash.
- Fixed an issue where trying to load an NDS ROM and a GBA ROM
  without GBA save data would fail.

## [1.0.3] - 2024-01-30

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where most screen gap sizes would not be honored.
- Fixed an issue where usernames with non-ASCII characters would crash the core
  or be improperly truncated.
  Such names are now properly converted to UCS-2 if possible,
  or else the default username is used instead.

## [1.0.2] - 2024-01-19

### Changed

- Add support for screen gaps between 0 and 126 pixels, inclusive.
  128-pixel gaps are no longer available due to
  libretro limits on how many core option values can be defined.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the emulated console could not connect to the network.

## [1.0.1] - 2024-01-12

### Fixed

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-12

First stable release.

### Fixed

- Rename the Android build artifact to `melondsds_libretro_android.so`
  to adhere to libretro's naming conventions.
  If you installed it manually, be sure to remove the older release.
- Fixed an issue where the version number would be displayed incorrectly
  in the core information menu.
